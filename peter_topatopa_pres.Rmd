# Team Organization

- ### We used pair programming to read in, clean, and wrangle the four data sets we worked with

- ### Using our single, joined data frame, we individually explored different variables and relationships

- ### As a group we decided which relationships to present on and create a final visualization with

- ### Daniel created our final visualization, Halina documented our workflow and how we set up the project, and Peter created the rmarkdown presentation, and detailed our group roles

# Results

### We plotted mean yearly SiO<sup>2</sup> concentrations at each site and found a large decrease that coincided with Hugo

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/peter_sio2_plot.png")

# Results

### We also plotted gage height at all sites as a time series surrounding Hugo and found an inverse relationship with SiO<sup>2</sup>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/peter_gage_plot.png")

# Results

### We combined the two plots into a final visualization comparing gage height and SiO<sup>2</sup> conc. over time at the four LEF sites
